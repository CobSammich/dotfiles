# CobSammich's Dotfiles

Contains various dotfiles used on my personal Arch Linux system.

* Window Manager: i3-gaps
* Terminal Emulator: Alacritty (and sometimes xfce4-terminal)
* Bar: [i3status-rust](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust)

* `home` contains all the configuration files that should be stored in your home directory: `~`.
* `config` contains all the configuration files that should be stored in `~/.config`

> Note: I decided to hide API keys by making sample files that remove the API keys. Thus, when
updating all dotfiles, I must replace the API key placeholder with the actual API key.
